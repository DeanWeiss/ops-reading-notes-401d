# Threat Modeling
A threat model is a structured representation of all the information that affects the security of an application. Threat Modeling can be applied to a wide range of things; software, applications, systems, networks, distributed systems, Internet of Things, business processes.

## Four Question Framework

<ul>
  <li> What are we working on? </li>
  <li> What can go wrong? </li>
  <li> What are we going to do about it? </li>
  <li> Did we do a good job? </li>
<ul>
<br>
Assess Scope - What are we working on? This might be as small as a sprint, or as large as a whole system.
Identify what can go wrong - This can be as simple as a brainstorm, or as structured as using STRIDE, Kill Chains, or Attack Trees.
Identify countermeasures or manage risk - Decide what youâ€™re going to do about each threat. That might be to implement a mitigation, or to apply the accept/transfer/eliminate approaches of risk management.
Assess your work - Did you do a good enough job for the system at hand?
