### Security Testing Basics
- Vulnerability Assessment: The system is scanned and analyzed for security issues.
- Penetration Testing: The system undergoes analysis and attack from simulated malicious attackers.
- Runtime Testing: The system undergoes analysis and security testing from an end-user.
- Code Review: The system code undergoes a detailed review and analysis looking specifically for security vulnerabilities.

### More About Pen Testing
- Penetration Testing (pentesting) is carried out as if the tester was a malicious external attacker with a goal of breaking into the system and either stealing data or carrying out some sort of denial-of-service attack.

- Pentesting has the advantage of being more accurate because it has fewer false positives (results that report a vulnerability that isnâ€™t actually present), but can be time-consuming to run.

- Pentesting is also used to test defence mechanisms, verify response plans, and confirm security policy adherence.

- Automated pentesting is an important part of continuous integration validation. It helps to uncover new vulnerabilities as well as regressions for previous vulnerabilities in an environment which quickly changes, and for which the development may be highly collaborative and distributed.

### The Pentesting Process
- Explore: The tester attempts to learn about the system being tested. This includes trying to determine what software is in use, what endpoints exist, what patches are installed, etc. It also includes searching the site for hidden content, known vulnerabilities, and other indications of weakness.
- Attack: The tester attempts to exploit the known or suspected vulnerabilities to prove they exist.
- Report: The tester reports back the results of their testing, including the vulnerabilities, how they exploited them and how difficult the exploits were, and the severity of the exploitation.
