# Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
<p>
Is a technology for authenticating users and devices in the digital world. The basic idea is to have one or more trusted parties digitally sign documents certifying that a particular cryptographic key belongs to a particular user or device. The key can then be used as an identity for the user in digital networks.

X.509v3 - This is the standarized machine-readable certificate

Common Use Certificates
Secure Web Sites - HTTPS: The most familiar use of PKI is in SSL certificates. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is the security protocol used on the web when you fetch a page whose address begins with https:. TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a newer version of the protocol. In practice, most websites now use the new version.

Email Signing - Certificates are also used for secure email in corporations. The S/MIME standard specifies a message format for signed and encrypted messaging, using the X.509 certificate formats.


Security Limitations
Any person with certificate authortiy can sign for any person or computer. Also susceptible espionage, malware, injecting and forging messages.
