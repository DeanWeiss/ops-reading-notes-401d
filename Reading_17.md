# Virtual Private Cloud

A VPC is a public cloud offering that lets an enterprise establish its own private cloud-like computing environment on share public cloud infrastructure.

VPCs are a “best of both worlds” approach to cloud computing. They give customers many of the advantages of private clouds, while leveraging public cloud resources and savings. The following are some key features of the VPC model:
<ul>
  <li> Agility: Control the size of your virtual network and deploy cloud resources whenever your business needs them. You can scale these resources dynamically and in real-time. </li>
  <li> Availability: Redundant resources and highly fault-tolerant availability zone architectures mean your applications and workloads are highly available. </li>
  <li> Security: Because the VPC is a logically isolated network, your data and applications won’t share space or mix with those of the cloud provider’s other customers. You have full control over how resources and workloads are accessed, and by whom. </li>
  <li> Affordability: VPC customers can take advantage of the public cloud’s cost-effectiveness, such as saving on hardware costs, labor times, and other resources. </li>
</ul>

Each VPC’s main features readily translate into a benefit to help your business achieve agility, increased innovation, and faster growth.
<ul>
  <li> Flexible business growth: Because cloud infrastructure resources—including virtual servers, storage, and networking—can be deployed dynamically, VPC customers can easily adapt to changes in business needs. </li>
  <li> Satisfied customers: In today’s “always-on” digital business environments, customers expect uptime ratios of nearly 100%. The high availability of VPC environments enables reliable online experiences that build customer loyalty and increase trust in your brand. </li>
  <li> Reduced risk across the entire data lifecycle: VPCs enjoy high levels of security at the instance or subnet level, or both. This gives you peace of mind and further increases the trust of your customers. </li>
  <li> More resources to channel toward business innovation: With reduced costs and fewer demands on your internal IT team, you can focus your efforts on achieving key business goals and exercising core competencies. </li>
</ul>
