# SOC 2 Compliance

<p> SOC 2 is a framework that many businesses today are using. It isn't a hard and fast rule set but a framework. A SOC 2 certification is a good start on letting your customers know you care and want their trust.

SOC 2 has 5 Principles

  <ol>
    <li> Security </li>
    <li> Confidentiality </li>
    <li> Availability </li>
    <li> Integrity </li>
    <li> Privacy </li>
  </ol>
  
  SOC 2 Type 1 and Type 2
  
  SOC 2 Type 1 - Are all security controls that are in place designed properly?
  
  SOC 2 Type 2 - This period typically covers six months the first time, and then a year thereafter. This approach emphasizes immediate action taken toward improving your security, and because Type II also covers Type I, there are financial savings in the long term if you start with Type II from day one.
