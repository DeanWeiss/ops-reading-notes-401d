# CIS Benchmarks

<p>"Developed by a global community of cybersecurity professionals, CIS Benchmarks are a collection of best practices for securely configuring IT systems, software, networks, and cloud infrastructure." - ibm.com </p>

### There are seven layers of core categories of CIS Benchmarks:
<ol>
  <li> <strong>Operating systems benchmarks</strong> cover security configurations of core operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Apple OSX. These include best-practice guidelines for local and remote access restrictions, user profiles, driver installation protocols, and internet browser configurations. </li>
<li> <strong>Server software benchmarks</strong> cover security configurations of widely used server software, including Microsoft Windows Server, SQL Server, VMware, Docker, and Kubernetes. These benchmarks include recommendations for configuring Kubernetes PKI certificates, API server settings, server admin controls, vNetwork policies, and storage restrictions. </li>
<li> <strong>Cloud provider benchmarks</strong> address security configurations for Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google, IBM, and other popular public clouds. They include guidelines for configuring identity and access management (IAM), system logging protocols, network configurations, and regulatory compliance safeguards.
<li> <strong>Mobile device benchmarks</strong> address mobile operating systems, including iOS and Android, and focus on areas such as developer options and settings, OS privacy configurations, browser settings, and app permissions. </li>
<li> <strong>Network device benchmarks</strong> offer general and vendor-specific security configuration guidelines for network devices and applicable hardware from Cisco, Palo Alto Networks, Juniper, and others. </li>
<li> <strong>Desktop software benchmarks</strong> cover security configurations for some of the most commonly used desktop software applications, including Microsoft Office and Exchange Server, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari Browser. These benchmarks focus on email privacy and server settings, mobile device management, default browser settings, and third-party software blocking. </li>
  <li> <strong>Multi-function print device benchmarks</strong> outline security best practices for configuring multi-function printers in office settings and cover such topics as firmware updating, TCP/IP configurations, wireless access configuration, user management, and file sharing. </li> 
</ol>
