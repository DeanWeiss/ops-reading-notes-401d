# Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) with AWS

The article goes over how an attack took advantage of misconfiguration of the firewall and incorrect permission settings. This allowed the attack to gain entry and then move latteraly within their systm. 

The article then goes onto explain what recommendations that the Company could have taken using AWS Governance Practices. It also goes into detail on the configuration that could be set up to also prevent those attacks.

The article basically shows how flawed configuration and failure to pay attention to detail can cost you and your customers a lot of money and that by taking the extra time to ensure security you can prevent a lot of headache and financial ruin.
