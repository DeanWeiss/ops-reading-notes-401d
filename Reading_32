# What is Malware Analysis

Malware Analysis Process Here’s a more in-depth insight into the malware analysis process:  
<br>
<br>
Step 1: Capture the malware.  Before the actual analysis, you need access to a malicious piece of code in an uncompressed format. You can use a tool like HoneyDB to attract malware and capture it in an investigation-friendly environment.  
<br>
<br>
Step 2: Build a malware lab.  A malware analysis lab is a safe environment where you can test different malware functionalities without any risk to nearby files. Typically, malware labs rely on virtual machines (VMs) to sandbox the entire exercise. 
<br>
<br>
Step 3: Install your tools.  You can use several tools to analyze malware, including open-source and paid options. There is plenty of support to be found on GitHub. You could also use Cuckoo Sandbox and other equivalent analysis enablers. These tools must be installed in your VMs.  
<br>
<br>
Step 4: Record the baseline.  Before running the malware, assess the operating environment and document it as your baseline. The tools installed in the VMs will help here — running these same tools later (after the malware is activated) indicates malware behavior and impact.

Step 5: Commence your investigation.  There are several phases involved in the investigation step. Some require intense manual involvement, while others can gain from automation tools. Take the malware apart before initiating these phases to reveal its properties at every layer.  
<br>
<br>
Step 6: Document the results.  Depending on the tools you’re using, you will have detailed information on malware behavior, tendencies, and interaction patterns with its surrounding digital environment. Consolidate these results into an exhaustive document that forms the deliverable for your malware analysis exercise.  Malware analysis is at the heart of cybersecurity innovation today. Analysts can work with governments, non-profit organizations, research institutions, and corporates to develop the body of knowledge around malware.
