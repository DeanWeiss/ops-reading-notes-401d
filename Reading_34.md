# What is Computer Forensics

### Cyber forensics jobs.
There are many job titles associated with cyber forensic work including:

- Information security crime investigator. An information security crime investigator often works specifically with lawyers and law enforcement to find evidence that may be on computers, phones, or other technology as part of a criminal investigation.

- Computer forensics engineer. A computer forensics engineer focuses on evaluating software and architecture to help learn what happened in a breach or threat.

- Digital forensics. Digital forensics is another term for cyber or computer forensics, which is the basic idea of analyzing data and software to learn how a breach occurred, or look for evidence. 

- Computer forensics. Computer forensics is another term for cyber or digital forensics, which is the basic idea of analyzing data and software to learn how a breach occurred, or look for evidence.

- Cyber forensics. Cyber forensics is another term for cyber or digital forensics, which is the basic idea of analyzing data and software to learn how a breach occurred, or look for evidence.

- Computer forensics specialist. A computer forensics specialist is a more entry-level position in the field, focusing on scans and research into a breach.

- Computer forensics analyst. A computer forensics analyst focuses on analyzing data and information to help provide as evidence in a cyber crime, or in understanding a data breach. 

- Computer forensics investigator or examiner. A computer forensics investigator or examiner is similar to a forensics analystâ€”they are responsible to dive deep into programs and software to learn about a digital breach or a hack, and help recover data.

- Computer forensics technician. Computer forensics technicians are responsible for the more detailed, technical work of forensics systems. They may be in charge of data recovery, logging information about a breach or attack, or pulling specific data as evidence for law enforcement. 

### Cyber forensic job responsibilities.

In the world of computer forensics, there are important responsibilities involved with correctly conducting an investigation and gaining knowledge about a breach or hack. There are six stages of a computer forensics examination looking for information or evidence involving cyber crime. Those six stages are: 

- Readiness. This stage helps the investigator make sure they are ready to take on investigation at any time. They ensure everyone has been trained correctly, ensure they understand legal ramifications of investigations, plan ahead for technical and non-technical issues, and make sure their equipment is ready anytime. 

- Evaluation. This happens when a team is given information about an investigation. They assign roles and resources to the team, get details on facts and particulars about the case, and identify risks of the investigation. 

- Collection. This involves the collection of evidence and learning about the cyber attack or cyber crime. Many tools and techniques are used to obtain this data, and can involve conducting interviews, obtaining the hard drives and other devices, and more. Devices are sealed in evidence bags to be further evaluated at the forensics lab. 

- Analysis. This part of the investigation is vital to success. Evidence and data collected are analyzed to get as much information as possible about the breach or crime. This can involve who performed the crime, when it happened, what data was lost, digital evidence, and more. The analysis must be accurate, must be documented and recorded, it must be unbiased, and it must meet correct deadlines. 

- Presentation. After analysis, the team presents a summary of its findings. They offer strategies to companies to help them increase their security and prevent issues in the future. A presentation will also be given to a court of law that needs details about the forensics evidence. 

Review. After the process is completed, the forensics team will do a review of how their investigation went, talk about things to improve in the future, and evaluate how to better serve in the next investigation.

### There are many duties a cyber forensics expert may have in their day including:

- Conduct data breach investigations

- Recover and examine data from computers or electronics

- Identify additional systems or networks that may have been compromised

- Compile evidence for legal cases

- Draft technical reports and write declarations to prepare evidence for trial.

### Computer forensic skills.

There are many specific skills that a computer forensic expert will need to be successful at their job. Those include both hard skills and soft skills. 

##### Hard skills.

- Computer hardware and software

- Operating systems

- Networks

- Programming languages

- ISO standards

- COBIT and ITIL frameworks

- Cybersecurity systems and standards

- Soft skills.

- Organization

- Analysis

- Communication

- Presentation

- Time management

- A cool head under pressure
