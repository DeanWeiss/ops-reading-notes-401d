# What is a Burp Suite?

It is a suite of tools from PortSwigger that help penetration testing of web applications on HTTP and HTTPS. It can intercept web requests and edit them in real time. 

- Intruder allows you to import a request and then configure arrange of payloads to attempt and can then run through them automatically. 
- Repeater allows you to import a web request and then make manual modifications to it and see the response side by side allowing you to make minor adjustments to attempted exploits and easily see if itâ€™s working. A dashboard feature shows a list of identified issues, although these need to be manually checked for false positives.
- Sequencer is designed to analyse the randomness of data such as session IDs, CSRF tokens, and password reset tokens. 
- The analysis requires more than 100 samples but can identify weaknesses in how supposedly random values are being generated. 
- Decoder allows you to decode strings from a range of encoding standards as well as allowing you to encode data again. 
- Comparer allows you to compare two strings to check for minor differences.
