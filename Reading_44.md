# Metasploit

<p>
"During the information gathering phase of a pentest, Metasploit integrates seamlessly with Nmap, SNMP scanning and Windows patch enumeration, among others. There's even a bridge to Nessus, Tenable's vulnerability scanner. Pretty much every reconnaissance tool you can think of integrates with Metasploit, making it possible to find the chink in the armor you're looking for...

Once on a target machine, Metasploit's quiver contains a full suite of post-exploitation tools, including privilege escalation, pass the hash, packet sniffing, screen capture, keyloggers, and pivoting tools. You can also set up a persistent backdoor in case the machine in question gets rebooted.
