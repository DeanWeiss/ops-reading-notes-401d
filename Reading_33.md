# What is Threat Hunting and Why is it so important?
- Search the network for signs of compromise. Target C2 communications.
- It is an active/proactive, not reactive. Results are not alert driven. Target behaviour, not 'signatures'
- Should include all devices -servers, desktops, network hardware, IIoT, BYOD..
- Output is a compromise assessment. Are any of our systems currently compromised?
